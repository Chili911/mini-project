Our project is a web-based bookstore system created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It allows users to register, log in, search for books, and either borrow or buy them. The project starts with the index.html page, which contains the registration form. After registering , if the login is successful, they are directed to browse.html, which serves as the main page where books are displayed.

The browse.html page shows a list of books fetched from books.json, which acts as our data source. Each book has details like title, author, price, and status (available or borrowed). Users can use the search bar to filter books and click Borrow or Buy to interact with them. The script.js file manages all the functionality, including form validation, user login, book display, search filtering, and local storage. Styling for all pages is handled by style.css for a clean and user-friendly design. We also added a session feature on the payment page, where if a user does not complete the payment within 15 minutes, they are automatically redirected to the home page. This helps manage sessions and improves the flow of the website.

This mini-project helped us understand key concepts in web development, such as form handling, data storage, DOM manipulation, and session logic using JavaScript. It also improved our teamwork and experience with GitHub for version control. The project was developed by the group members: Khadija, and Arqam.
